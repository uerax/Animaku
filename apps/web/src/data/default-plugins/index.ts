 * Built-in rules — keep lean.
 * Order: HLS-friendly first; Anime1 last (needs MEDIA_FULL_PROXY=1 for cookie mp4).
 * - otage: MacCMS (otage.cc), plaintext m3u8 via player_aaaa
 * - xifan: 稀饭 anime.xifanacg.com — suggest API search + HTML chapters + player_aaaa
 * - MXdm: MacCMS-style third party
 * - omofun: 211dm/omofuns — server search adapter (verify gate) + XPath chapters + player_aaaa
 * - LIBVIO: release-page 类型 (libviogroup.github.io) — XPath search + XPath chapters + player_aaaa (encrypt=3)
 * - Anime1: progressive + cookie adapter (client disables when mediaFullProxy=0)
 * More sources: Settings, catalog / import (7sefun, AGE, gugu3 still folder-only).
